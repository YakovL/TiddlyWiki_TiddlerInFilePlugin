This plugin for [TiddlyWiki 2.x](https://classic.tiddlywiki.com) allows to store tiddlers as external files
(given that the used saver/server supports loading and saving files).
For instance, plugin developers can use their favorite IDE for external js files without need to copy them back and forth.
More generally it's useful when you need to have "the source of truth" outside TW.

This plugin, like many others, are available to install via [ExtensionsExplorerPlugin](https://github.com/YakovL/TiddlyWiki_ExtensionsExplorerPlugin) (to find it, install the central collection and YLExtensionsCollection from it).
